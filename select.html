            <h1>Select a Memory</h1>
            <p>Quickly select the individual memory you would like to work on. Make sure that the memory is an individual memory and not a behavior, a thought, collection of memories, etc. Step B should be very quick (10-15 seconds or less). Our goal is to select the memory quickly without generating any distress</p> 
            <p>Do not think about the memory, play the memory, or have any feelings about it in this moment. If you encounter problems, see click on "Help" in the menu bar. <strong>It is a really good idea to select a small memory to start with (not a top 10 horrible memory).</strong></p>
