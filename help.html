            <h1>Help</h1>
            <p>If you are struggling with working on the memory, use the four skills discussed at the beginning of this process. If you need a reminder, here are their descriptions.</p>
            <a href="/container.html" class="button">Container</a>
            <a href="/calmscene.html" class="button">Calm Scene</a>
            <a href="/grounding.html" class="button">Sensory Grounding</a>
            <a href="/shopvac.html" class="button">ShopVac</a>
            <h1>Common concerns</h1>
            <p>If too much of the bad memory is playing or too much distress appears when you look at it briefly, immediately ShopVac and use Sensory Grounding.</p>
            <h2>Too much distress continues to happen</h2>
            <p>Here are some options you can try: 1) watch this video and practice micro-activating to help you glance at the memory faster 2) try to glance briefly at a different part of the bad memory (like a part of the memory before the really bad part happens) 3) try tossing an object–like a small ball, pen, or other small item–the air and catch it. Only think about the bad memory while the object is in the air. 4) work on a different memory (one that your intuition tells you may be more tolerable).</p>
            <h2>The bad memory intrudes into my calm scene. </h2>
            <p>Immediately stop as soon as you realize this is happening. Catch that distress/intrusion, contain it, then push it 2,000 miles way from you. Push it far, far, away–so far that it cannot come back in the 30 seconds you will be in the calm scene.</p>
            <h2>Other memories want to come. </h2>
            <p>Do not let them. Send them into a huge vault. We work on only one memory at a time in these approaches.</p>
            <h2>You are not giving me enough time to container the distress. </h2>
            <p>If it is taking you a while to container the distress, you are probably over-activating the memory and having too much distress appear. Try looking at the memory for 1/20th of the time that you looked at it last round.</p>
            <h2>There isn’t time to Sensory Ground or ShopVac the distress that appears.</h2>
            <p>You’re already in the calm scene before I can get the distress out. This is fine. Spend the time that I am in the next round of the calm scene and the next round of checking the memory doing your ShopVac and Sensory Grounding instead. Then join the calm scene with blinks on the following round. We do not need to be in perfect sync 100% of the time. Do the tasks you need to do and turn off the narration for that round of working that memory. Rejoin the flow on the next round.</p>
            <h2>A part of me won’t let me access the memory. </h2>
            <p>It is probably not a good idea to try to access this memory right now. Ask if there is another memory that would be more tolerable to work on now. Or, return later.</p>
            <h2>This process is not working for me.</h2>
            <p>You may need to do this for 30 minutes before you notice any real change in the memory. Are you thinking about a single bad memory very quickly, containing the distress, and going into your calm scene and doing blinks as guided? If so, is your calm scene causing you to have a pleasant experience over and over? If not, change your calm scene.</p>
            <h2>Content is coming on a sensory channel that I’m having trouble containing.</h2> 
            <p>If you are stuck in a sound that is from the bad memory, try turning up the volume on your calm scene. You can also try to imagine the sound going into a sound-proof box. Then see that box go into your container. Send the container away. If what is distressing is a thought, imagine that thought being written down and contain the written version of that thought.</p>
            <h2>If you are finding yourself feeling more grounded now and able to return to working on the memory, feel free to resume that process.</h2>
