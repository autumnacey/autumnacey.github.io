            <p>In this approach, we are going out of our way not to activate the memory more than we can catch, container, and push out of awareness.  Remember, even baseball catchers wear vests and guards.  It is probable at some point when doing this work that you will glance quickly at the memory and the distress will just show up in your body.  <strong>If you are having distress from the memory in your body, stop.  Use this skill that Iâ€™m about to show you.</strong>  It may take a while of using this skill for it to solidify and become strong enough to be helpful.</p>
            <p>Have you ever used a ShopVac, a hand-held vacuum, or dropped quarters in a car wash vacuum cleaner? If so, imagine turning on the vacuum and imagine the vacuum pulling air into the hose.  Now scan your body and find any points of distress (not from any memory, just your regular right now stress).  Search for a knot, pressure, tension, movement, heaviness, or emptiness.  If you find it, just imagine moving the hose over that area and imagine that stress just going into the hose like a kind of colored smoke.  Not so close that it pulls the skin, just close enough to get some of that distress out of your body.  Now the vacuum canister is the container.  Push the vacuum canister and hose out of your awareness until they are tiny specks on the horizon.  Good. </p>
            <p>Were you able to imagine that?  If so, the more you use this resource the stronger it is likely to work.  If not, try to see if you can scoop distress out of your body with metaphorical hands.  Or, see if imagining a bright healing light moving through you helps shift it out of you.</p>
            <p>When overactivation does occur and shows up in your body.  Try to get it out.  When it is out, glance a the memory the next time I guide you to for 1/20th of the time that you looked at it last time, because you probably looked at it too long.</p>
