            <h1>Sensory Grounding</h1>
            <p>Difficult experiences teach us things.  Sometimes they over-teach us things.  One of the key differences between really difficult memories and normal memories is that parts of us may not know that the bad experience is over.  These experiences may be stored in the part of the brain that can’t know what is over from what isn’t.  So when we think about a bad experience, it may feel like it is happening now.  We may have the feelings, sensations, and beliefs of the bad experience.  One of the things that helps and one of the essential skills that you are likely to need is sensory grounding to let you quickly connect to the safety of the present.  Using your senses to ground brings you home.  So, anytime you are confused about where your shoes are in this moment, you can do this.  Before we start, look around you and see if you can find something that has a pleasant smell. It can be a candle, a perfume, an essential oil, a drink, or even something like Chapstick.  Also see if you can find something that has a taste, like maybe a piece of candy or a drink.</p>
            <p>We will check the senses for only a few seconds each.  You can always experiment with doing this slower or in deeper ways later.</p>
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>I invite you to look around your current room and notice several objects.  Notice the color(s) of that object.  If you were to touch it, would it be hard, soft, or some other texture?</p>
            <h2>Touch</h2>
            <p>If there is a piece of furniture near you, touch that piece of furniture and notice if the temperature is warmer, cooler, or the same temperature as your hand. Good.</p>
            <p>As you move your fingertips across that surface, notice if the surface is completely smooth or if it has a texture.  Good.</p>
            <p>As you move your fingertip across that surface, do you notice any changes in temperature? Good. </p>
            <h2>Sound</h2>
            <p>I’m going to be very quiet, just notice several things you hear in order of loudest first. Good.</p>
            <h2>Smell</h2>
            <p>Now I invite you to smell the object that you selected and you have near you. Good.</p>
            <h2>Taste</h2>
            <p>Now taste whatever you have near you to taste. If you don’t have anything, just notice the sense of taste in this moment.</p>
            <br> <hr> <br>
            <p>Did that grounding exercise let you feel a little more connected to the current space you are in?  If so, good.  If not, keep trying it.  Also notice which of the senses seemed to be most powerful in connecting you with the present.  Those are the senses that we will start with should you need to find the safety of the present.</p>
