            <h1>Develop the Container</h1>
            <p>In this approach, we are going to work one memory at a time.  We will glance at that memory very, very, fast.  Think about an old-school camera with a shutter that could open and close in 1/128th of a second.  That’s the speed that we will start with.</p>  
            <p>We will try to get one one tiny piece of distress at a time out of this memory.  Like trying to work one frame at a time in a video.  You’re not having thoughts about it or feeling any kind of way about that content.  You’re not figuring anything out.  Whatever content that emerges will be immediately put into an empty container and pushed far out of awareness.  We are also not thinking about the memory as a whole and we are not handling anything other than the microslice that comes out in the very quick glance that we take on the memory.  And that little tiny piece that comes out each time we glance at the memory… whatever it is… we are handling like a hot potato and containing it and pushing it out of awareness.</p>
            <p>If we are always immediately containing whatever comes out of the memory, we need to develop the container.  Yes, this container is usually imaginary.  It can be a box, file cabinet, cookie jar, safe, vault, mailbox, rocket ship, or fast-moving train.  So, when you hear me say container to hold a tiny piece of something, what comes to mind?  Pause here if you need to.</p>
            <p>Once you have identified that container, try to see it.  Pause and google images of it if you need to.  When you settle on the container you want, try to see its color.  Try to see what its walls are made of.  Pause here if you need to.</p>
            <p>Notice how the door opens and closes.  Does it make a noise when it opens and closes?  Does it have a feeling in your hands as you push the door close and latch it?</p>
            <p>Once you have a good idea of how that container works, see if you can open the empty container and see a slip of paper go into it.  Something like a post-it note or a random business card.  See it go into the container and see the door close.  Now, take a step back.  Does it feel like what you put in there is in there?  If you are not sure open it up in your imagination and see.  If you need to, try again.</p>
            <p>Now, see the container and push it far, far, away from you.  So far that it’s just a tiny speck on the horizon.  Were you able to see it get smaller and smaller?</p>
            <p>Don’t go forward until you have a container that works because this approach requires that we get distance quickly from the distress that comes out of the memory. For those of you who struggle visualizing, make the container an actual object, like an actual box that you are holding in your actual hands.</p>
