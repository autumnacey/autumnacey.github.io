            <h1>Preparing to Work on a Memory</h1>
            <p>Hi.  I’m Tom.  I want to show you one way that humans can heal from difficult individual memories or experiences.  I can almost guarantee you that this approach is different from what you are used to doing. The skills that I will show you before working on any memory are very important.</p>
            <p><strong>If you skip forward, you are very likely to have difficulties that you wouldn’t have otherwise.  This pathway works because of your ability to do these skills I will teach you.</strong></p>
            <p>You may be able to get through the preparation parts of this site in about 20 minutes.  And, once these skills are in place, you can skip this and go directly to the memory work.</p>
            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>I’m Thomas Zimmerman and I’m a mental health therapist in Ohio. However, this is not a therapy site nor is it a substitute for seeing a trauma therapist.  To be crystal clear, I’m not your therapist.  I’m not selling anything here and I do not benefit financially in any way from you using this site.  I’m not looking for nor am I accepting new clients.  I’m simply here to show you one way that we can reliably, predictably, and easily heal using pathways that have been inside us for as long as we have been human.  Learn how to do this in this way and it is likely to work. Once you see how this healing pathway works, you can make a practice of it to help you better manage past, present, and future stressful experiences.</p>
